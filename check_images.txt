Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: no ,
		RESNET model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg as "saint bernard, st bernard," the same breed as 			    	 Dog_01.jpg.
		VGG model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg as "english setter," a different breed from Dog_01.jpg.
		ALEXNET model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg as "bernese mountain dog," a different breed from 					Dog_01.jpg.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
		All three model architecture achieved a 100% accuracy in correctly classifying images as dogs or not dogs
        None of the model architecture achieved a 100% accuracy in correctly classifying the breed of dogs.
        VGG model architecture and ResNet architecture had 0% accuracy in correctly classifying the breed of dogs.
		Only ALEXNET model architecture achieved a 50% accuracy in correctly classifying the breed of dogs.
        When considering the above facts AlexNet model architecture selected as the best model architecture                 on uploaded image classification.
